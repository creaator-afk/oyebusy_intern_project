Worse, they pose serious healthy risks as they carry with them allergens and bacteria that can trigger asthma attacks and other allergies. If you’re looking for guidance on </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.urbancompany.com/cart?city=city_mumbai_v2&amp;category=pest_control\"><span style=\"color:rgb(110, 66, 229);\">how to get rid of cockroaches</span></a><span>, know that prevention is better than cure. But before we go down that road, let’s first understand what causes cockroach infestation in the first place. Before we don’t understand the root of the problem, we won’t be able to solve it.</span></p><h2>Why are there suddenly cockroaches in my house?</h2><ol><li>The tropical weather aids cockroach breeding</li><li>Food spillage and poorly disposed garbage</li><li>Moisture in your home</li><li>As eggs from used cardboard cartons and grocery bags</li><li>Cockroach infestation in the neighbourhood</li></ol><p><span>There could be several reasons why cockroaches enter your home.</span></p><ol><li>The tropical weather aids cockroach breeding</li></ol><p><span>For starters, it doesn’t help that we live in a tropical country. Cockroaches, like other insects, breed in humid and tropical weather conditions. So no matter where you live — even in the most expensive real estate in the country — you’re likely to find cockroaches anyway. They may not be in your line of vision every day but rest assured they will be there, in a corner of your garage, a common toilet that isn’t cared for, etc.</span></p><ol><li>Food spillage and poorly disposed garbage</li></ol><p><span>Cockroaches also thrive on all kinds of organic matter — crumbs, spills, pet food, and especially decaying garbage. If you’ve not taken care to properly dispose of garbage from the previous night’s house party, chances are it will attract cockroaches by the next morning.</span></p><ol><li>Moisture in your home</li></ol><p><span>Cockroaches also need access to water. So, if your pipes are leaking, if there’s condensation, or those nooks and crannies under your sink and the spaces under your refrigerator and microwave, haven’t been tended to, cockroaches will find a way to get there.</span></p><ol><li>As eggs from used cardboard cartons and grocery bags&nbsp;</li></ol><p><span>There’s also the possibility that you brought the cockroaches into your home unwittingly. It is amazing how often these pests make their way into your home as cockroach eggs laid in used cardboard cartons and grocery bags at infested stores.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li>Cockroach infestation in the neighbourhood</li></ol><p><span>It could get worse. You could be as responsible as you possibly can — disposing of garbage responsibly, cleaning up after every meal, even ensuring all those hidden nooks are spic and span — and still attract cockroaches! If there’s a cockroach infestation in your neighbourhood or your building hasn’t been very strict with its cleanliness protocols, cockroaches will find a way into your home through shared walls and pipes too.</span></p><h2>How do I stop cockroaches from coming in my room?</h2><ol><li>Keep your home clean</li><li>Get your home checked for leaks and moisture</li><li>Be careful of what you bring into your home</li><li>Seal entry points</li><li>Use anti-cockroach spray every night</li></ol><p><span>Prevention is always better than cure. So, if you’re asking yourself how to prevent cockroaches, you’re on the right track. To prevent cockroaches from entering your home, it would help to follow some if not all of these steps. Of course, there’s not much you can do about the weather but consider the following:</span></p><ol><li>Keep your home clean</li></ol><p><span>This may be the most obvious thing to say but it cannot be overstated just how far a clean home can go in preventing cockroaches from entering. This would include, cleaning up after every meal, ensuring the garbage — especially wet garbage — is disposed of properly, cleaning the kitchen platform thoroughly and putting away all leftovers in closed containers and in the refrigerator. Make sure places like the areas under the sink, around the garbage bin, and below appliances like the refrigerator are clean and dry.</span></p><ol><li>Get your home checked for leaks and moisture</li></ol><p><span>Cockroaches are attracted to dark and moist places. So make sure you have none. Get the plumbing checked; get the leakage fixed; and most definitely take a long hard look at every place that has a tap and a water source.</span></p><ol><li>Be careful of what you bring into your home</li></ol><p><span>Luggage, used furniture, or grocery bags and cartons are the easiest ways for cockroaches to get into your home. Before bringing them in, carefully inspect them for signs of cockroach eggs.</span></p><ol><li>Seal entry points</li></ol><p><span>Inspect your room for cracks, crevices, and gaps around windows, doors, pipes, and vents. Seal these openings using caulk, weather stripping, or door sweeps.</span></p><ol><li>Use anti-cockroach spray every night</li></ol><p><span>This might seem tad extreme, but you will be surprised how effective it is to use an anti-cockroach spray every night. Just spray it in the cockroach-prone areas — eg under the sink, under the fridge, behind the microwave, around the bin, etc — and let it sit for the night. Typically, cockroaches are most commonly found in kitchens so you can simply shut the kitchen door after spraying and let the repellent do its job.</span></p><h2>How do you get rid of cockroaches naturally?</h2><p><span>While there are ways to get rid of cockroaches at home naturally, nothing can be as effective as a bug spray. That being said, if you’d like to get rid of cockroaches naturally, here are some ways.</span></p><ol><li>Boric acid and sugar or flour</li><li>Essential oils</li><li>Baking soda paste</li><li>Bay leaves</li></ol><p><span>Professional pest control services offer the most effective solution for severe infestations. So, if you find yourself facing one, make sure to book an appointment with Urban Company — to clean your home and pest control it too. But if it’s a mild infestation and you’re looking to get rid of cockroaches, you can do the following:</span></p><ol><li>Boric acid and sugar or flour</li></ol><p><span>Dust some boric acid and sugar/flour on a paper plate and leave it in the infested area. Sugar and flour act as baits for cockroaches and boric acid works as a toxin that can kill the cockroaches.</span></p><ol><li>Essential oils</li></ol><p><span>Create a spray using essential oils like peppermint or lavender and spray them in areas which attract most cockroaches. The scents that we find pleasant are repelling to cockroaches.</span></p><ol><li>Baking soda paste</li></ol><p><span>A baking soda paste works in the cruellest manner you can imagine. When you apply the paste in areas where cockroaches are active, they will consume it. Once they do, the baking soda will expand their stomachs and cause them to rupture, killing them.</span></p><ol><li>Bay leaves</li></ol><p><span>Just as essential oil, the scent of bay leaves is repellent to cockroaches. Leave clean dry bay leaves in your kitchen shelves and all the usual spots where cockroaches congregate.</span></p><p><span>Cockroach infestations can be a daunting problem, but with the right approach, you can reclaim your pest-free home. If this seems like a terribly tedious thing to do, you could simply book a pest control appointment with Urban Company and let the pros do their job.</span></p>",

This year, he’s already made over Rs. 1 lakh in the months of March and April, working as a carpenter.</p><p>Umesh’s story is not uncommon. He comes from a traditional farming family in Darbhanga, Bihar. Eight years ago, he dropped out of school and came to Delhi, in search of work. He says, “There was only one school in our village and the teachers were not very interested. And of course, I was never a very good student myself. I regret it now, but it’s too late for me. However, I want my brothers to get the opportunity I didn’t have.”</p><p>It was this dream that led him to his first job as a helper, under a contractor, when he first came to Delhi. He would carry back breaking loads in the punishing heat of the summer, and do any number of odd jobs, for a meager daily wage, just so he could save up money to send back home for his brothers’ education.</p><p>“There Were Times When I Thought I Should Just Quit. I Didn’t Know For Sure If I Could Support Myself Like This, Let Alone My Family. But, I Knew I Had To Keep Working If I Wanted My Brothers To Do Better In Life.”</p><p>Umesh soon completed his training as a carpenter and took up a job as a helper with a small firm in Delhi. He was earning better but, apart from sending money home, he now also had a household of his own to support. Then, in November last year, he happened to see an Urban Company ad for carpenters online and called the number given.</p><p>One week later, Umesh was officially an Urban Company partner. “It wasn’t easy at first- the first couple of months, I made 70-80 calls each month. I wouldn’t even know how to speak to customers at first, but, I didn’t want to give up just like that. After that, I kept pushing myself, kept running around, hoping it would pay off. I used to call Deepak sir at Urban Company every day, and he coached me on how I should communicate with customers. I could never have done this on my own.”</p><p>Now, Umesh’s income has steadily increased over the months until, in the past two months, he’s been making over Rs. 50,000 each month. Now, he says, “One of my younger brothers’ has just registered for a B.A. course- the first person in the family to go to college. Now, he won’t have to run around like me. Hopefully, he can even get a government job”</p><p>We all know the importance of a formal, systematic education. But, sheer determination and the will to succeed are the things that truly count, when it matters.</p>",
